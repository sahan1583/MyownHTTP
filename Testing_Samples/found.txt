Request
Host - GET, PUT
Host  -> The "Host" header field in a request provides the host and port information from the target URI, enabling the origin server to distinguish among resources while servicing requests for multiple host names.

Host: :port - optional 

GET /pub/WWW/ HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.org

Connection - GET, PUT
Connection ->  The "Connection" header field allows the sender to list desired control options for the current connection.  Connection options are case-insensitive.

Connection: close

Date - GET, PUT
Date -> The "Date" header field represents the date and time at which the message was originated, having the same semantics as the Origination Date Field (orig-date) defined in Section 3.6.1 of [RFC5322]. The field value is an HTTP-date, as defined in Section 5.6.7.

Date: <day-name>, <day> <month> <year> <hour>:<minute>:<second> GMT

Accept - GET, PUT
Accept -> The "Accept" header field can be used by user agents to specify their preferences regarding response media types. For example, Accept header fields can be used to indicate that the request is specifically limited to a small set of desired types, as in the case of a request for an in-line image.

text/html if the file asked in the url has extension .html 

application/pdf if the file asked in the url has extension .pdf -> type: 

image/jpeg if the file asked for has extension .jpg

text/* for anything else

text/html: "Accept: text/html"
application/pdf: "Accept: application/pdf"
image/jpeg: "Accept: image/jpeg"
text/: "Accept: text/"

Accept-Language - GET, PUT
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 

The If-Modified-Since - GET
The If-Modified-Since request HTTP header makes the request conditional: the server sends back the requested resource, with a 200 status, only if it has been last modified after the given date. If the resource has not been modified since, the response is a 304 without any body;

If-Modified-Since -> GET only 
If-Modified-Since: <day-name>, <day> <month> <year> <hour>:<minute>:<second> GMT

Content-Type - PUT
